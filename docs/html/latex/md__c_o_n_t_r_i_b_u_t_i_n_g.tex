\begin{quote}
If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/blob/main/Documentation/BuildInstructions.md}{\texttt{ Documentation}}. \end{quote}
Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/issues}{\texttt{ Issues}} that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open an \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/issues/new}{\texttt{ Issue}}.
\item Provide as much context as you can about what you\textquotesingle{}re running into.
\item Provide project and platform versions (IDE, compiler, operating system), depending on what seems relevant.
\end{DoxyItemize}

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{I Want To Contribute}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md15}

A good bug report shouldn\textquotesingle{}t leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure that you are using the latest version.
\item Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.\+g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/blob/main/Documentation/BuildInstructions.md}{\texttt{ documentation}}. If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section).
\item To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Typeissues?q=label\%3Abug}{\texttt{ bug tracker}}.
\item Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the Git\+Hub community have discussed the issue.
\item Collect information about the bug\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Stack trace (Traceback)
\item OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, mac\+OS, x86, ARM)
\item Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
\item Possibly your input and the output
\item Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsubsection{How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md18}

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}. \end{quote}


We use Git\+Hub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open an \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/issues/new}{\texttt{ Issue}}. (Since we can\textquotesingle{}t be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
\item Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
\item Please provide as much context as possible and describe the {\itshape reproduction steps} that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
\item Provide the information you collected in the previous section.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Once it\textquotesingle{}s filed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The project team will label the issue accordingly.
\item A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as {\ttfamily needs-\/repro}. Bugs with the {\ttfamily needs-\/repro} tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
\item If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked {\ttfamily needs-\/fix}, as well as possibly other tags (such as {\ttfamily critical}), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsection{Suggesting Enhancements}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md19}
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for R-\/\+Type, {\bfseries{including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality}}. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsubsection{Before Submitting an Enhancement}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md20}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure that you are using the latest version.
\item Read the \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/blob/main/Documentation/BuildInstructions.md}{\texttt{ documentation}} carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
\item Perform a \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/issues}{\texttt{ search}} to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
\item Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It\textquotesingle{}s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project\textquotesingle{}s developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you\textquotesingle{}re just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-\/on/plugin library.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysubsubsection{How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md21}
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/issues}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub issues}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use a {\bfseries{clear and descriptive title}} for the issue to identify the suggestion.
\item Provide a {\bfseries{step-\/by-\/step description of the suggested enhancement}} in as many details as possible.
\item {\bfseries{Describe the current behavior}} and {\bfseries{explain which behavior you expected to see instead}} and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
\item You may want to {\bfseries{include screenshots and animated GIFs}} which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use \href{https://www.cockos.com/licecap/}{\texttt{ this tool}} to record GIFs on mac\+OS and Windows, and \href{https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast}{\texttt{ this tool}} or \href{https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz}{\texttt{ this tool}} on Linux.
\item {\bfseries{Explain why this enhancement would be useful}} to most R-\/\+Type users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{Your First Code Contribution}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md22}
Please look at the \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/blob/main/Documentation/BuildInstructions.md}{\texttt{ Build Instructions}} in order to set up the project on your side. Then, you might be able to improve the project by testing your feature and submitting a \href{https://github.com/aureliancnx/R-Type/pulls}{\texttt{ Pull Request}}.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysubsection{Improving The Documentation}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md23}
You can improve the contribution regarding the project documentation on several aspects\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item By creating diagrams to represent the architecture of the project (or of the network or graphical engine)
\item By using the explanation of the network protocol used for the R-\/\+Type set (RFC)
\item By explaining the use of the project in a more global context
\item By commenting on parts of the code if you find that it would not be clear enough for other users
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{Styleguides}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md24}
\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{Commit Messages}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md25}
Please use clear messages for your commits. Ideally, a commit message should include first\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the type of change you made\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item DEL\+: did you delete part of a code/file
\item CHG\+: a change to a piece of code
\item FIX\+: a correction of an existing problem in the code
\item ADD\+: adding a feature or a part of a code
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item the name of the file (optional but useful in some cases), e.\+g.\+: \char`\"{}\+ADD (\+Network\+Manager.\+cpp)\+: Compression method management\char`\"{}.
\item The content of the change to be made \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t use information like \char`\"{}small change\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}minor refactor\char`\"{} which are quite unreadable and prevent from knowing what you are talking about directly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, don\textquotesingle{}t make the commit message too long on the first line. If you want to detail your reasoning/modification, prefer a first line that indicates in one sentence (without all the details) the change you are making, then skip a line and write the details of this change.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsection{Branch names}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md26}
We strongly recommend that you use clear branch names, which are used for a particular modification.

Indeed, using your Github username or a single word in your branch name is not clear at first glance.

We invite you to use the following standard for modifications\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ft/\+XXXXX\+: add a feature
\item fix/\+XXXXX \+: fix a feature
\end{DoxyItemize}

For example, in the case of adding a Keep\+Alive package in the project, a sufficiently clear feature name would be\+: feature/network-\/packet-\/keepalive
